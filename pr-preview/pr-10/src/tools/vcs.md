# Version Control

Git is the most popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds(founder of Linux) to help manage the Linux kernel project.

### What is a version control system?

A version control system keeps the record of the changes made by tracking the modifications made so that everything is in organized order and if something goes wrong we can get back to our previous state. It is used to keep different versions of the history of any project.

### Why use git?

- It is really hard to manage a project. More so the projects that include code, as changes in lines span across various files.
- it's harder to understand the nature of changes by just looking at the changes in code, without re-understanding the context
- easier to work with multiple people

It is recommended to learn git, as soon as you start writing code. To make a habit of good code practices
