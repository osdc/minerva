# Elixir

Elixir is used to build highly scalable, fault-tolerant applications. It's a functional language, and leverages the BEAM VM(Virtual Machine), which erlang and [many other languages](https://github.com/llaisdy/beam_languages) use.

Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE)(The Soul of Erlang and Elixir • Sasa Juric • GOTO 2019) talk for a high level overview of Elixir(& BEAM VM).
