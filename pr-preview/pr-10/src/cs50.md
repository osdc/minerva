# CS50

CS50 is an introductory computer science course by Harvard and Yale University. The course is run on-campus and online. The name is a play on "101"s being the introductory courses of their respective subjects. This signifies the inclusive nature of the course, one popular metric the instructor likes to quote is that around 70% people taking CS50 have no prior experience in writing code.

- The first week talks about the representation of numbers in binary, and the general thought process of iterative thinking i.e. giving the student a good experience of "thinking like a computer"
- Subsequent weeks, talk about basic algorithms and pointers.
- And continue to various topics, such as web servers, etc.

It is a great resource to get started in computer science. It provides a basic intuition of computer science, which goes a long way.

Whether you're interested in web development or systems programming, this is one of the best ways to get started.
